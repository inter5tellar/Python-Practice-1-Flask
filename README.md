# Python-Practice-1-Flask
Practicing with Flask and WTForms in Python.
This is a current work in progress.

I'm using VSCode on Windows 10. Pip installed Flask & WTForms.
Files in 'static' and 'templates' folders should stay within these folders.
These folders should be placed in your project folder.
Any images used for the site should be stored in the 'static' folder.

app.py line 30 includes a session key if you wish to randomize.
I have not provided any images in 'static'.
You can either create an image in that folder named 'nasalogo.jpg'
or find, replace 'nasalogo.jpg' with a different image within 'static'
that you add.
